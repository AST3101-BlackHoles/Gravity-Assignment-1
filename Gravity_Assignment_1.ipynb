(The brackets $\\langle \\ldots \\rangle$ denote a time average over $\\sim1$ orbit.) \n",

How do these orbital separations compare to the typical radius that we expect massive stars to reach during their evolution (i.e. as red giants)? In a sentence or two, describe why this imposes a theoretical challenge for evolving a massive binary star system into a binary black hole system that evolves within the age of the Universe. In another sentence or two, describe one of the proposed theoretical \"solutions\" to overcoming this challenge. (Suggested reading: [Mandel & Farmer (2018)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05820)) "

    "Common envelope evolution (see [Ivanova et al. 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00159-013-0059-2) for a review) is typically approximated with an energy balance equation describing the transfer of binary orbital energy $E_\\mathrm{orb}$ to the binding energy $E_\\mathrm{bind}$ of the common envelope. The idea is that some of the binary's orbital energy gets transferred to unbind the common envelope. When the common envelope is expelled, it carries away this orbital energy, and as a result, the binary tightens. However, the efficiency $\\alpha$ of the common envelope in carrying away orbital energy is not known. $\\alpha$ is defined so that:\n",

    "where $m_{1,i}$ is the initial mass of the star initiating common envelope, $m_{1,f}$ is its post-common envelope mass, $m_2$ is the companion mass, $a_i$ is the initial orbital separation and $a_f$ is the final orbital separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $\\alpha$ is highly uncertain, and may be smaller or larger than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question:\n",
    "Fixing all other parameters of the system, describe how the final orbital separation depends on $\\alpha$. For large values of $\\alpha > 1$, would the final orbital separation be larger or smaller compared to small values of $\\alpha < 1$? How do you think the value of $\\alpha$ affects the merger rate of binary black holes that are formed from common envelope evolution?
